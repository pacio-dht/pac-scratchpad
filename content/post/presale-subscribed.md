On 27 December 2017 the Pacio Seed Presale became fully subscribed, thanks to the contributor mentioned in Pacio Seed Presale Update taking up the balance, with this quote:

I firmly believe at this point that Pacio will contribute to building a better world, and I am grateful to be able to participate in this amazing adventure üôÇ

Thank you!

With that contribution and vote of confidence, Pacio is on its way.

The Seed Presale is now closed, and EIP20 (ERC20) PIOE transfers can be made.

Much consultation and thinking took place in November and December, resulting in an even better project, we believe, with this short form Vision:

The Pacio Vision is to transform accounting and real time management, to help the ‚ÄúBlockchain Revolution‚Äù deliver its full potential benefit to the world.

Cryptocurrency, decentralisation, blockchain, distributed ledger, and smart contract technologies provide hope of enormous positive change for business, government, and society, in a ‚ÄúBlockchain Revolution‚Äù which could result in a safer, more inclusive, and more productive future.

By providing the means to organise, track, and keep score of all that is happening in a standardised, easy to use, semantic way, and then to maximise the benefits, Pacio can become the default choice, the standard setter, and thereby play a key role in the revolution in progress achieving its potential.

The full revised Vision is up on the site. The new White Paper to spell out the details, and to replace the current Concept Paper, will be published in 2018. [Update: the White Paper and related papers plus new Vision are live on the site.]

We look forward to an exciting 2018, and thank everyone who has helped Pacio reach this take off point!
