### Introduction

Pacio was conceived to help address the shortfall in achievement of the internet’s promise to provide knowledge, choices, opportunities, and prosperity inclusively and equitably.

The internet is one of mankind’s greatest inventions and successes. However, it could be even better than it is today – much better. The actual versus potential shortfall is due to centralisation, where a few entities and governments have usurped the potential, resulting in some of the greatest concentrations of power, wealth, and opportunities for crime, that the world has ever seen.
Blockchain technology can avoid the centralisation problem by distributing processing and data validation around the world. There is no central point of control or failure, and no trusted third party is required. This eliminates power concentrations, centralised system crime, and costly, slow intermediaries.

For these reasons, blockchain technology has been described as a disruptive technology and the greatest IT invention of the 21st century. It will rival the internet in significance.
But first and second generation blockchains were slow, and incapable of handling world scale applications. Thus, they were only a potential solution to the problem. Many people have realised this, resulting in numerous third generation initiatives. These systems move closer to a solution, but still lack much of the data intelligence, accounting, and management required for effective development of applications.

This lack is the problem Pacio will fix.

Forty years ago the Pacio founders revolutionised accounting with the introduction of packaged vertical market computerised accounting for the profession and business.

Today, they recognise the internet shortfall and have launched Pacio to help fix it.
