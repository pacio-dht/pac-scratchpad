The Pacio Vision is to empower online applications to realise the capability of decentralised blockchain and database technologies to provide safer, more inclusive, fairer, more productive, lower cost systems and new opportunities for society, business and government.

Pacio will do this by supplying a development and deployment platform that extends decentralised technologies to make them suitable for widespread use by applications, wherever the apps run. Pacio will add broad accounting, management, and semantic data functionalities that are interoperable across entities, jurisdictions, standards, apps, and blockchains, plus a cryptocurrency with a purpose, comprehensive governance capabilities, and an ecosystem of tools and services.

The Pacio platform will simplify development of decentralised apps, whether blockchain based or not, and make it more feasible for apps requiring inter entity operation to achieve scale.

Pacio will help set accounting and semantic data standards for the decentralised technology era and become the default choice.

Pacio will deliver the semantic web and provide the most significant advance in accounting and management since the invention of double entry bookkeeping 500 years ago.

Decentralised technology with Pacio will result in an explosion of applications that truly deliver the internetâ€™s promise to provide knowledge, choices, opportunities, and prosperity for all safely, inclusively and equitably.
