<p>Pacio will achieve its vision via a high performance, scalable, low cost decentralised semantic blockchain based platform that provides a wide range of features and services for applications, wherever they run. Apps powered by Pacio will be ‘accounting’ or ‘management’ feature-rich at every level.</p>

<h3 id="accounting-and-management">Accounting and Management</h3>

<p>The focus on accounting and management is a key differentiator for Pacio resulting from the lifetime work of the founders. ‘Accounting’ and ‘management’ are used here in a broad sense to cover:
Standardised semantic blockchain</p>

<p>Pacio will use the Standardised Semantic Information Model (SSIM)  to store data</p>

<p>•   in a standardised way to be globally interoperable and comparable across entities, jurisdictions/regions, languages, and accounting standards, thereby reducing confusion and duplication, resulting in great productivity and efficiency savings</p>

<p>•   of any type whether financial or not in a semantic way = data referenced by its content or what it is about
to implement the standardised semantic blockchain. This will allow sematic querying, and standardised semantic reporting from simple to complex with interfaces to international standards and data/report languages such as XBRL.</p>

<p>The semantic blockchain will unlock the wealth of information and knowledge contained in entity and online data, for easy access via market specific or niche apps, which will help realise semantic web 3.0 hopes.</p>

<p>Totally flexible data definition ability via SSIM Taxonomiesi will help apps bridge older, traditional methods, to the new.</p>

<h3 id="business-improvement-via-tari">Business Improvement via TARI</h3>

<p>TARI (Target Average Rate Index), invented and developed by Pacio founders Dr Keith Cleland and Trevor Watters, is a management methodology built into Pacio. TARI allows feedback to effect business improvement in real time, rather than only by analysis after the event. TARI has proved to be the most effective and least expensive means of improving productivity and bottom line performance of business across the spectrum of manufacturing, retail, trade, transport and commercial services in general. TARI also has potential for positive impact on national productivity at no cost to government.
Other accounting and management features</p>

<p>Other ‘broad integrated accounting and management’ features are:</p>

<p>•   recording transactions in any fiat or crypto currency, or a mixture, with on the fly conversions
•   traditional double entry Dr and Cr accounting
•   blockchain triple-entry accounting, or Single Entry Accounting done right! (SEA)i as Pacio calls it
•   activity data is an important part of calculating and tracking productivity, and is used by TARI, but is not recorded by most accounting packages
•   controls over access to data so that the data creators control or own it, with data public or private at the creator’s wish
•   inter person, inter entity, and inter app transactions, including triggering via events for staged processes such as Interoperable Business Documentsi
•   inter blockchain transactions, because Pacio does not assume that one chain will rule them all, but the opposite, that the decentralised future will see a plethora of chains that Pacio can support and interconnect</p>

<h3 id="accounting-and-management-levels">Accounting and management levels</h3>

<p>The accounting and management features are available at one, two, or three levels as applicable to the app:</p>

<p>•   for the app, and possibly the app developer if different from the entity running the app
•   for the entity running the app
•   for users of the app</p>

<p>The accounting and management need</p>

<p>Every non-trivial app, whether business focussed or not, will benefit from the Pacio ‘accounting and management’ facilities, yet current blockchains lack them, and apps have often skipped or skimped on them, other than those intrinsic to the app, because it is has been too hard, or even impossible when viewed from the perspective of a single app. Apps powered by Pacio will not need to compromise on ‘accounting’ or ‘management’ at any level, and therefore will be far more useful to users at all levels.</p>

<p>Wide Range of Features for Applications</p>

<p>Pacio’s wide range of features for applications and its broad integrated accounting and management functionality, include some which come as a result of Pacio using 3rd generation blockchain and distributed technologies, and some from Pacio specific services. It is the combination which provides the overall benefit for mass adoption applications. The list of these features will continue to grow over time with community interaction.</p>

<p>Inherited third generation blockchain and decentralised database features
Inherited third generation blockchain and decentralised database features available to apps using Pacio are:</p>

<p>•   Improved safety and removal of the concentration of power, wealth, and opportunities for crime of centralised systems, with no central point of control or weakness
•   Removal of the need for trusted third parties thanks to blockchain Byzantine fault tolerant consensus, and immutability within the life of the blockchain for relevant data. This can simplify systems, reduce costs, increase speed (of processes), and remove opportunities for fraud.
•   Zero cost transactions for apps using the Pacio blockchain or other zero fee blockchains, that will facilitate general apps, and new ones eg micropayment systems. (Transactions for apps using fee based blockchains such as Bitcoin or Ethereum would still involve fees.)
•   Scalability – able to handle large scale applications
•   Responsiveness with transactions confirmed within seconds for apps using the Pacio blockchain or other high speed blockchains, not minutes or hours as for some current blockchains
•   Smart contracts or dApps – distributed apps - for apps using the Pacio blockchain or other blockchains that support smart contracts
Enhanced blockchain features
Blockchain and 3rd generation blockchain features enhanced by Pacio are:
•   Cryptocurrency with multiple purposes, the PIO:
o   is used by app deployers to pay for network, storage, and advanced API use, optionally converted to any other currency at payment time
o   is fully traceable, to provide a clear trail in the event of theft
o   serves as a general cryptocurrency
o   pays an issuance reward of 25% of newly minted PIOs in proportion to the PIOs held
•   Governance emphasis re a constitution and voting, including governance app support, and the role of the Pacio Governance Council
Additional services
Services additional to the features listed above will be developed progressively in accordance with community priorities and requests, with an initial proposed list being:
•   Global digital identity support for individuals and entities
•   Data exchange/monetisation support for decentralised data exchange (DDEX) apps
•   Authenticated accounting and other real world data feeds made available for app or oracle use
•   Event triggers to initiate intra or inter app/entity app actions based on internal or external events
•   Governance support to governance apps to be written
•   Ricardian contracts (internet of agreements) support
•   An Internet of Things (IoT) interface
•   An artificial intelligence interface</p>

<p>How</p>

<p>Pacio features and services will be provided to applications via the Pacio API (Application Programming Interface). Any app or dApp (smart contract), wherever it runs, whether blockchain based or not, will be able to use the Pacio API. Utilities for administration, wallet operations, and real time public data capture processes will support the API services. The technology to be used by Pacio is described in section 10 Technology of the White Paper.</p>

<p>Pacio is open source. Pacio is committed to working with its community of users and developers to develop the ecosystem for the everyone’s benefit. A major part of this will be an emphasis on governance, both within Pacio itself, and via a member controlled Pacio Governance Council. Pacio Core Ltd will provide ongoing development, nurture the ecosystem and help manage its evolution.
The Cost</p>

<p>Pacio crypto transactions and some basic API ops will be free. Database storage and bandwidth, plus more sophisticated API use, will involve a fee to cover the costs of running Pacio and of continuing its development. Fees will be payable by the entity running an app, not the user of the app, unless the app developer chooses to charge. Fees can be paid in the entity’s choice of cryptocurrency, with PIO as the default.</p>

<p>The Result</p>

<p>Pacio will simplify development of powerful market or niche specific apps. Apps powered by Pacio will:
•   provide real time feedback to improve business results
•   efficiently process zero fee crypto, fiat, or other payments/transfers/transactions between people and entities
•   eliminate double entries for inter entity exchanges
•   reduce costs
•   increase safety
•   reduce disputes
•   speed payments
•   permit inter entity/jurisdiction/app operations or comparisons
•   facilitate audit where needed</p>

<p>This will enable developers to open new ways of doing business, all with integrated automatic accounting and real time management.</p>

<p>Data ownership and control will be returned to its creators, who will be able to benefit from the value their data represents if they so choose, rather than large centralised organisations.
The PIO will be attractive as a general safe cryptocurrency beyond direct Pacio use. However, Pacio will also support other cryptocurrencies, so the choice of crypto will be up to the user.
In these ways Pacio will achieve its vision:</p>

<p>The Pacio Vision is to empower online applications to realise the capability of decentralised blockchain and database technologies to provide safer, more inclusive, fairer, more productive, lower cost systems and new opportunities for society, business and government.
The Pacio concepts have been decades in the making. The confluence of third generation blockchains, and ICOs for funding, make them achievable.</p>
